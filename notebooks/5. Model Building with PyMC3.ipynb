    "Bayesian inference begins with specification of a probability model relating unknown variables to data. PyMC3 provides the basic building blocks for Bayesian probability models: stochastic random variables, deterministic variables, and factor potentials. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **stochastic random variable** is a factor whose value is not completely determined by its parents, while the value of a **deterministic random variable** is entirely determined by its parents. Most models can be constructed using only these two variable types. The third quantity, the **factor potential**, is *not* a variable but simply a\n",

    "## The FreeRV class\n",
    "\n",
    "A stochastic variable is represented in PyMC3 by a `FreeRV` class. This structure adds functionality to Theano's `TensorVariable` class, by mixing in the PyMC `Factor` class. A `Factor` is used whenever a variable contributes a log-probability term to a model. Hence, you know a variable is a subclass of `Factor` whenever it has a `logp` method, as we saw in the previous section.\n",

Points in parameter space are represented by dictionaries with parameter names as they keys and the value of the parameters as the values.\n",

    "## Sampling with MCMC\n",
    "\n",
    "PyMC's core business is using Markov chain Monte Carlo to fit virtually any probability model. This involves the assignment and coordination of a suite of **step methods**, each of which is responsible for updating one or more variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "The user's interface to PyMC's sampling algorithms is the `sample` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sample(draws, step=None, start=None, trace=None, chain=0, njobs=1, tune=None, \n",
    "        progressbar=True, model=None, random_seed=None)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`sample` assigns particular samplers to model variables, and generates samples from them. The `draws` argument\n",
    "controls the total number of MCMC iterations. PyMC can automate most of the details of sampling, outside of the selection of the number of draws, using default settings for several parameters that control how the sampling is set up and conducted. However, users may manually intervene in the specification of the sampling by passing values to a number of keyword argumetns for `sample`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assigning step methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The `step` argument allows users to assign a MCMC sampling algorithm to the entire model, or to a subset of the variables in the model. For example, if we wanted to use the Metropolis-Hastings sampler to fit our model, we could pass an instance of that step method to `sample` via the `step` argument:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with my_model:\n",
    "\n",
    "    trace = sample(1000, step=Metropolis())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or if we only wanted to assign `Metropolis` to a parameter called `β`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with my_model:\n",
    "\n",
    "    trace = sample(1000, step=Metropolis(vars=[β]))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When `step` is not specified by the user, PyMC3 will assign step methods to variables automatically. To do so, each step method implements a class method called `competence`. This method returns a value from 0 (incompatible) to 3 (ideal), based on the attributes of the random variable in question. `sample` assigns the step method that returns the highest competence value to each of its unallocated stochastic random variables. In general:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Binary variables will be assigned to `BinaryMetropolis` (Metropolis-Hastings for binary values)\n",
    "* Discrete variables will be assigned to `Metropolis`\n",
    "* Continuous variables will be assigned to `NUTS` (No U-turn Sampler)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Starting values\n",
    "\n",
    "The `start` argument allows for the specification of starting values for stochastic random variables in the model. MCMC algorithms begin by initializing all unknown quantities to arbitrary starting values. Though in theory the value can be any value under the support of the distribution describing the random variable, we can make sampling more difficult if an initial value is chosen in the extreme tail of the distribution, for example. If starting values are not passed by the user, default values are chosen from the mean, median or mode of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
